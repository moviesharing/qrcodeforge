## Core Features:

- Data Input: Input text, URLs, or upload files (txt, pdf) to be encoded in a QR code.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Medium sky blue (#7DD3FC) to convey trustworthiness and modernity.
- Background color: Light blue-gray (#F0F4F8), very low saturation for a clean, professional backdrop.
- Accent color: Slightly darker blue with hints of purple (#82A7FF) to provide subtle contrast on interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif for clean, modern readability.
- Use minimalist line icons for key actions such as download, upload, and generate.
- Use a clean, grid-based layout with ample white space to ensure readability and ease of use. Focus on a single column layout for mobile responsiveness.
- Subtle animations (e.g., fade-in, slide-up) when the QR code is generated and ready for download.
